# Motivation

Modern biomedical datasets measure patients across many modalities (genomics, transcriptomics, imaging, clinical traits). A central challenge in AI for biomedicine is learning unified representations across these heterogeneous measurements.

This repository demonstrates a lightweight framework for tensorizing multimodal biological data and learning patient embeddings using neural networks.

# Key Concepts

Multimodal Data Integration:
Combining heterogeneous biological measurements into a unified data structure.

Biological Data Tensorization:
Converting genomics, transcriptomics, and phenotypic data into machine-learning ready tensors.

Representation Learning:
Learning latent embeddings that capture biological variation and disease signals.

Patient Embeddings:
Low-dimensional representations of patients that enable clustering, similarity analysis, and predictive modeling.

Patient Similarity & Disease Clustering


# Example analysis:

Patients with high NPPA expression cluster with HF phenotypes - As a demonstration, the framework explores how expression patterns in cardiac-associated genes such as NPPA can influence patient clustering.
In the synthetic dataset included in this repository, patients with elevated NPPA and NPPB expression, combined with adverse clinical characteristics such as increased BMI and blood pressure, cluster together in embedding space.

This demonstrates how multimodal embeddings can capture biologically meaningful disease patterns.
