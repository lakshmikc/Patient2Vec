# Patient2Vec
Learning Multimodal Patient Representations from Omics Data- this is a lightweight framework demonstrating how heterogeneous biomedical measurements (genomics, transcriptomics, clinical traits) can be tensorized and embedded into a unified patient representation.

# Motivation

Modern biomedical datasets measure patients across many modalities (genomics, transcriptomics, imaging, clinical traits). A central challenge in AI for biomedicine is learning unified representations across these heterogeneous measurements.

This repository demonstrates a lightweight framework for tensorizing multimodal biological data and learning patient embeddings using neural networks.

# Key Concepts

Multimodal Data Integration:
Combining heterogeneous biological measurements into a unified data structure.

Biological Data Tensorization:
Converting genomics, transcriptomics, and phenotypic data into machine-learning ready tensors.

Representation Learning:
Learning latent embeddings that capture biological variation and disease signals.

Patient Embeddings:
Low-dimensional representations of patients that enable clustering, similarity analysis, and predictive modeling.

Patient Similarity & Disease Clustering


# Example analysis:

Patients with high NPPA expression cluster with HF phenotypes - As a demonstration, the framework explores how expression patterns in cardiac-associated genes such as NPPA can influence patient clustering.
